======

The latex files used to generate my CV and resume. I cloned the resume repo from [ctb](https://github.com/ctb/resume) to use his makefile and template.

Commits:

1. 2017-04-24: Started branch "social-experiment" to explore how social media badges look. Also added **Service** section and changed all lists to chronological order (newest first). *nb* this commit was written at 35,000' on Southwest flight 1848 but the wifi I paid for stopped working about the time I was ready to push these commits. I'm **not** bitter for missing out on the opportunity to push `git` commits while hurting through the air in a metal tube. Nope, **not** bitter.
1. 2017-04-25: Removed **Service** section. Was too much. 
1. 2017-05-21: Updated pubs, workshops.
